# letsroll

Personal Pet project to get me started on this new Rust thing.

## Goal
To create a library that can roll the complicated dice requests of tabletop rpg players, such as 
'Roll 12D12 fire and 4D4 force damages, reroll all the 1s, sum results by damage type'.
The library would also come with a commandline interface, so it works in a standalone way as well.

## Status
Not ready for anything. Not even for code review.

## Joke
Two sausages were frying in a frying pan. One says to the other, "Damn, it's hot in here"
The other said, "Oh my God! A talking sausage!"
